// multitasking--> different user work on same sever at same time

// multiprocesing--> mutliple process run in single system is called like crome,vscode,Notepad

/*
# thread is part of process and share memory of process
# when we within a process do multitasking that is called thread
# context switchin fast in thread

# flow of controll
without threading --> function blocking nature 
with threading --> non blocking nature function call concurrently


#creating thread in java 
1) Thread class
2) Runnable interface implements


parametters --> void sum(int a,int b);
arguments --> sum(4,5) --> it is actual value

concurrently --> at a time only one work (you-->chat then you-->cook)
parallelism --> all work at same time   (you-->chat and frnd-->cook)
